# EMMA

This is the home of the EMMA Accessibility Tool ("Empowering multi- and intermodal accessibility analysis"). For an overview about the EMMA project, please have a look at https://www.emma-accessibility.org/.
In this GitHub, you will find the main scripts to operationalize the EMMA model, as described in our paper "An Open-Source Modelling Methodology for Multimodal and Intermodal Accessibility Analysis of Workplace Locations" (see https://doi.org/10.3390/su15031947).

Please be aware that this repository does not include the necessary data (the relevant links are presented in the paper). Also, please get the latest version (for the thesis, release 1.5 was used) of OpenTripPlanner at the original source: https://www.opentripplanner.org/ 

*Hint: After intitially dropping the isochrone feature, which is critical for our approach, in the early releases of OTP2, the feature is now implemented again. Thus, for further developments of the EMMA approach, we recommend to have a look at OTP2 as well.*
